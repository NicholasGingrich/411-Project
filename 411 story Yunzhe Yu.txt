As a logged-in user, I would like to store my favorite shoes and get notifications from the app if the price of the sneakers drops in order to get the sneakers I want before they are out of stock.


Description: There should be a list of favorites like the “favorite” on NIKE, which can store the sneakers I want. Also, when I click on the sneakers on the favorites page, I should be able to show the price of the sneakers on each website. The most important thing is that it should send me an email or any other kind of notification to tell me if the price of the sneakers drops.


As a logged-in user, I would like to set the type of sneakers, the brand of the sneakers, etc in order to get a clear view of the price of the sneakers on each website. 


Description: 
This is like when I logged in to the main page of the website, I can set the exact type of sneakers i want, i.e. Air Jordan 1, Air Jordan 4. Ather that, the website will show me about a list of the picture of the shoes i selected. After I click the picture of the shoes, I will know the price for each website.
