As a logged-in user, I would like to store a list of my favorite shoes and get notifications from the app if the price of the sneakers drops, in order to get the sneakers I want before they are out of stock. There should be a list of favorites like the “favorites” on NIKE, which maintains a record of any shoe listings that I have specified as a favorite. When I click on favorites icons, I should be able to see a full comprehensive list of all of the listings designated as a “favorite”. Furthermore, I should be able to set a limit price for each listing where the application will notify me by email if the shoe price has fallen below the limit.
