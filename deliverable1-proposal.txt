411: First deliverable – Project ProposalsProposal 1: A synchronized app for college students to find the fastest transportation to their classes (or between any two locations). The transportation can be chosen from the bus, T, Uber/Lyft, walking, and so on. Weather conditions should be considered since different weather may change the time students spend on the road (especially in harsh weather). Traffic conditions should be considered since accidents may increase their time on the road significantly. Other elements will also be considered as factors in determining the fastest transportation.Proposal 2: The idea is that given a specific identifiable product, the web app would allow the user to compare prices of the user’s desired item across different websites offering the user the best price. The search queries could be as specific as a certain variation of a specific product (ex. GoTrax GmaxUltra Electric scooter) or they could be more vague like ‘xbox one controller’. The web app will display items it deems to be relevant while also allowing the user to sort the results by certain features (mainly price) but also reviews, specific retailers, etc. If this is too vague we could dedicate our web app to a more specific market perhaps music related goods, luxury clothes, cooking appliances, etc. and base our api requirement integration on what market we end up choosing.
